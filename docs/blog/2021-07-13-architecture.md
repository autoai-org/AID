# Architecture Introduction

> In this series, I will introduce more technical details inside AID, including its architecture, solutions to some problems, etc. In the meanwhile, I will also briefly explain some decisions along the way.

In the first chapter of this series, we will go through the project architecture together. After pulling the source code from GitHub, you will find there are 4 folders:

--- .github
--- assets
--- components
--- docs
